<ul>
  <li>
      The db folder contains two files in JSON format
      <ol>
          <li>countries.json</li>
          <li>infected.json</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>In countries.json contains a list of countries with the coordinates of the geometric center of the country, as well as id, name, population</li>
  <li>In infected.json contains statistics on the corona virus for different countries (infected, died, recovered, country id, date)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Plot the dependence of any one parameter (infected| / died| / recovered) on the date, on the Y â€“ axis-the amount, on the X-the date in the dd format.MM for at least three of any countries. Each chart must be signed with the name of the country (you can display it in a color legend).
